ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Rasel.  At Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology, I'm now finishing up my Bachelor of Science in CSE. My aspiration is to work as a software and web developer, use my abilities and knowledge to advance my career in an innovative organization and contribute to the organization's primary objectives for swift business growth. ðŸ’» I love to code, and I'm naturally outgoing, so I'm always ready for a good discussion or a difficult project. Machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing are my areas of interest in research.  ðŸš€ Let's connect!
